There's an even better match. The candidate record at index [1] is not a good match because it refers to \"Grand Turismo 4\", which is a different game altogether. However, the candidate record at index [5] is also not a good match because it refers to \"Prison Tycoon\".\n\nBut then I saw it: the candidate record at index [2] has a similar title and features as the given entity record!
