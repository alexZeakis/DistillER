designers more precise control in rotating skewing or distorting objects. for large images improved use of image cache provides significantly increased response time for previewing most effects and for manipulating objects. the new integrated image adjustment lab saves designers valuable time and is accessible from both corel photo-paint and coreldraw. design professionals often work with files that have poor color balance and contrast and they need to use multiple tools to make adjustments. the image adjustment lab addresses this problem by uniting a number of manual and automatic controls for common color and tone corrections providing an intuitive and fast way to achieve professional image adjustments. the image adjustment lab also lets users create snapshots of their adjustments with just one click. the snapshots appear below the working preview which lets users easily compare each snapshot against the original and choose the best result. built on the power of corel knockout the

instead the game allows you to customize your character's proficiencies and make dramatic changes to your skill set on the fly. also each character's set of statistics such as perception and belief predispose them toward one style of play or another. gameplay is primarily turn-based combat that occurs during randomly generated missions in search of targets or objects. you earn currency experience points and loot (such as weapons and other items) from accomplishing missions and defeating opponents. many missions have multiple stages and while it's possible to finish them on your own it's much more efficient to plow through them with a group of other players. the matrix online allows players to form groups of up to a dozen called crews that are more permanent in nature and multiple crews can come together to form a faction. in addition to fighting foes using hand-to-hand combat guns and viruses characters can create useful items by compiling them. one of the most enticing aspects of the matrix online is the promise of an evolving storyline that develops based on each players' actions ensuring that you will keep coming back not just for the thrill of the game but in order to see how the story turns out. both everquest games -- evolution and everquest ii -- take place in the world of norrath. view larger. everquest: evolution and everquest ii as the game that originally helped create the market for the massive multiplayer online role-playing genre the everquest line of role-playing games require little explanation. both everquest games -- evolution and everquest ii -- take place in the world of norrath but in everquest ii norrath has been stricken by a cataclysmic event that caused civilization to virtually collapse leaving only two main metropolises intact. in both evolution and everquest ii you must choose your character's race profession and alignment before you head out in to the world to gain experience win renown and hopefully become rich and powerful beyond your wildest dreams. everquest: evolution features the original game plus all of the expansion packs released so far including the ruins of kunark the scars of velious the shadows of luclin the planes of power and the legacy of ykesha. everquest ii includes the new world order a ton of original content breathtaking new graphics and several tweaks to gameplay such as a purely player-versus-environment gameplay design that removes the original everquest's option of attacking other players. as one of the most participated in and deeply developed massively-multiplayer online games ever created both everquest: evolution and everquest ii will provide you with virtually endless entertainment and challenges.
