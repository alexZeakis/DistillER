It ran for seven seasons on NBC from 1993 to 1999, and was succeeded by a TV movie, which also acted as the de facto series finale. The series was originally based on David Simon's book Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. Many of the characters and stories used throughout the show were based on events depicted in the book, which was also part of the basis for Simon's own series, The Wire on HBO.Although Homicide featured an ensemble cast, Andre Braugher emerged as the series' breakout star through his portrayal of Frank Pembleton. The show won Television Critics Association Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Drama in 1996, 1997, and 1998. It also became the first drama ever to win three Peabody Awards for best drama in 1993, 1995, and 1997. In 1997, the episode ''Prison Riot'' was ranked No. 32 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. In 2007, it was listed as one of Time magazine's ''Best TV Shows of All-TIME.'' In 1996 TV Guide named the series 'The Best Show You're Not Watching'. The show placed #46 on Entertainment Weekly's ''New TV Classics'' list.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 24, 1993. The teleplay was written Jorge Zamacona based on a story by executive director Tom Fontana, and the episode was directed by Bruce Paltrow. In the episode, Crosetti focuses his investigation into the shooting of Officer Thormann on one suspect, while Lewis continues to investigate. Meanwhile, Pembleton and Bayliss pursue different leads in the murder case of 11-year-old Adena Watson.The shooting of a police officer and the murder of young girl were both directly inspired by real-life events chronicled in David Simon's non-fiction book, Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, on which the series was based. ''A Shot in the Dark'' continued a string of guest appearances by actress Edie Falco as Eva Thormann, the wife of Officer Thormann.''A Shot in the Dark'' was seen by 8.9 million households in its original broadcast. Although an improvement over the previous episode ''Son of a Gun'', the rating was considered a disappointment, continuing the show's downward trend in ratings. ''A Shot in the Dark'' suffered in particular due to direct competition from the 35th Grammy Awards. The episode, along with the rest of the first and second seasons of Homicide: Life on the Street was released on DVD in the United States on May 27, 2003.

1968,5054," [COL] title [VAL] The Killer Punch/The Will of Death [COL] abstract [VAL] 'Sometime on the evening of October 19, 1990, the flamboyantly gay Sydney socialite Ludwig Gertsch was strangled with an elastic strap in the bedroom of his lover, Mr Vincent Esposito. His body was found, wrapped in a doona, in Blue Mountains scrub on November 11, 1990. In September 1994 a Sydney Coroner found that Ludwig Gertsch was strangled ''by a person or persons unknown''. But that's where the murder trail ends - his killer has never been brought to justice.The murder of Allen Hall at Warnervale, where he lived with Christine Hicks, the estranged wife of boxing mentor and horse trainer Cec Waters, presented a curious public with a cruel and twisted story. Water’s eldest son, Dean, eventually was charged with Hall’s murder. However, it would be revealed later that Dean had succumbed to his father’s demands. Cec Waters was depicted as a bullying, obsessive father, who was determined to make his three sons become boxing champions but slaves to his evil will.

Beck and Watts gagged the innocent, terrified child. Watts then raped and bashed her. He then callously, and without remorse, cut her throat while his cowardly wife and mother of six watched on. Six days later, a fruit picker discovered Sian's mutilated body, still dressed in her Year Seven Sunshine Beach School uniform, in a creek bed. The hunt for the killers and their arrest was led by Bob Atkinson, now Queensland's police commissioner. As a result of thorough and dedicated police work by Queensland detectives, and in concert with New South Wales police, Beck and Watts were located hiding in a motel at Long Jetty on the NSW Central Coast a few weeks later. Police believe Beck and Watts are linked to the murders of Sharron Phillips, 20, in Brisbane's outer west, Stella Mary Farrugia, 19, and Louise Bell, 10, in Adelaide. In 1995, Watts was convicted of the manslaughter of 31-year-old student, Helen Mary Feeney in late 1987. Beck gave evidence against Watts, though Ms Feeney’s body has never been found. In 2008 Beck was hospitalised and underwent heart surgery, but later died in hospital.

The murders were part of a much wider wave of violent hate crimes as gangs of youths roamed Sydney’s inner suburbs randomly bashing and killing gay men for sport.Among the victims at Bondi was Wollongong television newsreader, Ross Warren, a gay man who disappeared while visiting friends in Sydney in 1989. Ross Warren’s case was dismissed by police as a “probable accident”. But his mother conducted a long campaign to have her son’s disappearance finalised.Then, some ten years after he was first reported missing, Ross’s police file finally came to the desk of one courageous investigator who started to dig a little deeper.Detective Sergeant Stephen Page quickly realised that there was more to the Ross Warren case than was uncovered in the original investigation. The file contained a great many unanswered questions.As he read the file Detective Page began to uncover similarities with other murders and slowly the shocking pattern of violence and death began to emerge.Another murder victim was Bondi resident John Russell, a gay man who had inherited some money and was about to leave for the country to start a new life when his body was found at the foot of the Bondi cliffs.

1089,1224, [COL] title [VAL] rollercoaster tycoon 3 (mac) [COL] description [VAL] released back in 1999 the original rollercoaster tycoon took the gaming world by surprise managing to capture the attention of both hardcore gamers and casual novices alike. rollercoaster tycoon 3 not only contains all of the same charm and joy of the original but wraps it up in a spectacular three-dimensional package. you can now rotate the camera and zoom in and out which allows you to more clearly see where a new ride will be placed and exactly how it will fit in your park. the 3d rendering also shows height and depth which isn't just a superfluous change but really assists you when building custom attractions. who knew that constructing and running an amusement park could be so much fun? now for the first time you can build operate and attend the amusement park of your dreams in rollercoaster tycoon 3. take a front row seat on any of your rides and zoom along with a pal. view larger. and speaking of the pals -- they are completely personalized with unique facial expressions and behaviors. view larger. who knew that constructing and running an amusement park could be so much fun? view larger. rollercoaster tycoon 3 allows four modes of play: tutorial career sandbox and custom scenario. the tutorial mode lets you quickly learn and experiment with how to set up and make use of all the game elements. sandbox mode provides you with a large map and unlimited money and makes all the rides scenery shops and paths immediately available. this mode is great for just having fun and creating that super amusement park you've always wanted without worrying about game elements such as time limits. the custom scenario as the name suggests lets you set up your own rules and requirements using the game engine. you can share custom scenarios with friends or find ones that other people have created and posted online. the career mode that constitutes the main gameplay is a bit different than it has been in the past with three goal sets of increasing difficulty for each scenario. your job in career mode is to build the theme park of your dreams by accomplishing certain goals for each scenario. these goals can range from pleasing vips who like clean parks or coasters with certain excitement values to keeping a certain number of people referred to in the game as peeps in your park for a specific amount of time. your ultimate goal besides providing entertainment to all is to work your way from apprentice though entrepreneur and eventually reach the lofty heights of tycoon. rollercoaster tycoon 3 includes a host of nice-touch elements. there is a fireworks display as well as an editor that lets you customize your fireworks. you can add music that plays in time to certain rides or with your fireworks show. you can light up the night with a stunning park-wide lighting system or take in the breathtaking vistas as nature intended with realistic sunsets moonlight and more. there is even a coaster cam that puts you right in the action. you can take a front row seat on any of your rides and zoom along with a peep. (the camera does such an amazing job of showing you what your death spiral coaster feels like that you might not want to play until at least an hour after you've eaten.) and speaking of the pals -- they are completely personalized fully-animated individuals with unique facial expressions and behaviors. for example teenagers often run straight to the high-excitement level coasters while the younger kids like to stay on the more gentle rides and the older folks tend to complain and chase both sets of kids around. you can even create your own family members and friends and add them to your park where they will actually take pictures that will download directly to your my documents folder. there's also a lot of content to explore as rollercoaster tycoon 3 includes five separate themes including generic spooky western adventure and sci-fi. each theme has distinctive rides amusements and shops as well as animatronics and decorations. the game's sweeping variety lets you do virtually anything from setting up water rides that have mechanical great-white sharks lurching out of the water to creating a roller coaster straight out of your imagination. there are 18 distinct scenarios in the game with two that are only playable when unlocked. beating the apprentice level of difficulty on each of the initially unlocked scenarios will unlock a new scenario but you have to beat the much more difficult entrepreneur and tycoon settings on all the levels to unlock the final two scenarios. when it comes to the creative aspect of the game rollercoaster tycoon 3 will allow players to create some spectacular parks with a level of detail they're sure to love. if you were a fan of the first two versions you'll love this one. but if you never played the originals but love theme parks you owe it to yourself to give rollercoaster tycoon 3 a try.

Corrupt police and a vast bribery network had kept the drug barons immune from prosecution until Donald Mackay's campaign finally led to raids by the State drug squad and several local marijuana growers were arrested and fined.During their trial the police informant was named publicly as Donald Mackay. Infuriated by the loss of more than $40 million, the leaders of the Griffith mafia, including the notorious Robert Aussie Bob Trimbole, put out a contract for Mackay's murder. Trimbole was shot in the car park of a Griffith hotel on a Friday night in July, 1977. The murder scene was awash with his blood and evidence showed he was shot a number of times from behind and his body then dumped into a car boot and driven away. Intensive investigations by police and even a Royal Commission have failed to locate it.

The brutal and random nature of the attack was eerily similar to ''In Cold Blood'', Truman Capote's world-famous study of a family murder in an isolated house in America.When the Greenough killer was finally tracked down, charged and convicted, much of the evidence was too horrific to be made public.

1968,4132," [COL] title [VAL] The Killer Punch/The Will of Death [COL] abstract [VAL] 'Sometime on the evening of October 19, 1990, the flamboyantly gay Sydney socialite Ludwig Gertsch was strangled with an elastic strap in the bedroom of his lover, Mr Vincent Esposito. His body was found, wrapped in a doona, in Blue Mountains scrub on November 11, 1990. In September 1994 a Sydney Coroner found that Ludwig Gertsch was strangled ''by a person or persons unknown''. But that's where the murder trail ends - his killer has never been brought to justice.The murder of Allen Hall at Warnervale, where he lived with Christine Hicks, the estranged wife of boxing mentor and horse trainer Cec Waters, presented a curious public with a cruel and twisted story. Water’s eldest son, Dean, eventually was charged with Hall’s murder. However, it would be revealed later that Dean had succumbed to his father’s demands. Cec Waters was depicted as a bullying, obsessive father, who was determined to make his three sons become boxing champions but slaves to his evil will.

Corrupt police and a vast bribery network had kept the drug barons immune from prosecution until Donald Mackay's campaign finally led to raids by the State drug squad and several local marijuana growers were arrested and fined.During their trial the police informant was named publicly as Donald Mackay. Infuriated by the loss of more than $40 million, the leaders of the Griffith mafia, including the notorious Robert Aussie Bob Trimbole, put out a contract for Mackay's murder. Trimbole was shot in the car park of a Griffith hotel on a Friday night in July, 1977. The murder scene was awash with his blood and evidence showed he was shot a number of times from behind and his body then dumped into a car boot and driven away. Intensive investigations by police and even a Royal Commission have failed to locate it.

area so the filled object can be moved copied or edited. powerful accurate tracing coreldraw graphics suite x3 provides a more streamlined integrated tracing solution that delivers accurate and optimized bitmap-to-vector tracing results. integrated with coreldraw x3 the new corel powertrace allows users to quickly and easily convert bitmaps into editable vector graphics. design professionals

powertrace generates a color palette that lets you easily pick which colors appear in the traced result and quickly convert them to the appropriate color mode including spot colors. you can also choose from several preset tracing styles color modes and background options. with three different preview modes -- before and after large preview and wireframe overlay -- corel powertrace makes it easy to analyze the result and adjust the settings used to trace your image. efficient photo editing coreldraw graphics suite x3 puts the focus on providing design professionals with more efficient intuitive and accurate photo editing. corel photo-paint x3 is now significantly faster when working with large images and applying photo effects resulting in better real-time feedback and improving overall workflow efficiency. improved object handling gives designers more precise control in rotating skewing or distorting objects. for large images improved use of image cache provides significantly increased response time for previewing most effects and for manipulating objects. the new integrated image adjustment lab saves designers valuable time and is accessible from both corel photo-paint and coreldraw. design professionals often work with files that have poor color balance and contrast and they need to use multiple tools to make adjustments. the image adjustment lab addresses this problem by uniting a number of manual and automatic controls for common color and tone corrections providing an intuitive and fast way to achieve professional image adjustments. the image adjustment lab also lets users create snapshots of their adjustments with just one click. the snapshots appear below the working preview which lets users easily compare each snapshot against the original and choose the best result. built on the power of corel knockout the enhanced cutout lab includes new controls to simplify the process of cutting out image areas and to improve accuracy. the new add detail and remove detail tools make it easy to refine the cutout area. for easy reference when defining the cutout area users can preview their cutout against the original image or transparent

one of the most significant developer tools releases since the introduction of visual studio nearly a decade ago. it offers developers of all types a wider spectrum of development possibilities and a greatly advanced design experience. team foundation server can track the versions of files under source control keep a record of their change history. view larger. easily find track and view bugs by using the bug list report. view larger. team edition for software architects includes the new application designer a visual design surface that helps software architects design configure implement and deploy service-oriented applications. view larger. the data that visual studio team system collects from the on-chip performance counters describes how your code behaves at its lowest level -- literally how the machine code is performing. view larger. microsoft visual studio team system is an entirely new series of productive integrated life-cycle tools that help development teams communicate and collaborate more effectively. it provides tools to support the entire software development team -- software architects developers and testers -- for a far more efficient development process. combining visual studio team system role-based products into an integrated suite of applications that address the needs of multifunctional roles in an organization the visual studio 2005 team suite includes team edition for software architects team edition for software developers and team edition for software testers. included is an msdn premium subscription that provides continuous priority access to the technologies you need to support visual studio team system and build a broad range of applications and web services. visual studio team system also includes the microsoft solutions framework (msf). msf is a highly customizable scalable fully integrated set of software development processes principles and proven practices designed to deliver the type of guidance desired by the user when and where it is needed. msf provides a seamless experience with visual studio team system for process automation and guidance within the software development life cycle. a better way to collaboratei today's software systems comprise numerous distributed services spanning platforms protocols programming languages and even geographies. successful deployment of advanced solutions depends on bridging the communication gap between development and operations so that the entire it department is represented early and often throughout the software life cycle. visual studio team system offers tightly integrated and extensible tools that enable software development teams to develop more efficiently by improving communication and collaboration throughout the development process. with team suite the project manager testers developers and architect know where they are on the project at all times. that means less time in meetings and on e-mail or the phone and more time delivering high quality. visual studio team features visual studio team system features a world-class development environment built on top of visual studio 2005 professional edition. with team system you can publish and administer web sites more easily with the powerful combination of asp .net 2.0 and visual studio 2005. with the built-in publishing features such as integrated file transfer protocol (ftp) you can keep files in your local project and synchronize them with files located on a remote web server. visual studio automatically logs copied files which helps you to identify whether the remote site has been updated with the latest files. and to help protect your site and your ip you can precompile a web site to publish only executable code no source files to your production server. team system also gives you the ability to clean all those unwanted files out of your solution in a one-click operation. simply choose clean solution from the build menu and all the intermediate files and output directories in your whole solution will be removed. the deployment designer in team edition for software architects allows application designs to be validated for deployment within a particular datacenter identifying possible issues before the deployment begins. service oriented applications often involve multiple components that may reside on different servers and have a variety of configuration and communication requirements. the team edition for software architects deployment designer can be used to validate an application for deployment in a particular

are new flying mounts in outland; tons of new and dangerous monsters (including epic world bosses); hundreds of new quests and items; and even a new profession: jewelcrafting. of course this isn't the end of the list -- this is just a glimpse of what blizzard has planned for their unreleased expansion pack. the new story the rumors and more several years have passed since the burning legion's defeat at mount hyjal and the races of azeroth have continued to rebuild their once shattered lives. with renewed strength the heroes of the horde and alliance have begun to explore new lands and have broken through the dark portal to investigate the realms beyond the known world. in this expansion pack the burning crusade refers to the burning legion's ongoing efforts to destroy life on azeroth. to date the burning legion's exploits have been documented in warcraft iii and in the war of the ancients novel trilogy. as part of the expansion pack players will now be able to travel through the dark portal to confront the legion on otherworldly battlefields. although only one race has been revealed blizzard has announced plans to unveil details about possible additional races at a later date. on the other hand many details have been released about the new continent outland. players last visited outland in warcraft iii: the frozen throne alongside illidan as he conquered the pit lord magtheridon's domain. players will also gain access to quel'thalas the region to the northeast of the forsaken lands where the blood elves reside. blizzard says that this expansion pack holds even more new areas that are ripe for player exploration -- additional details will be revealed in the months ahead. blizzard also has plans to add new dungeons and battlegrounds with the expansion though the exact number has not yet been determined. one upcoming dungeon that has players excited is karazhan which is located within medivh's tower. because medivh has played such a central role in warcraft lore blizzard is convinced that longtime players will be especially interested in seeing what karazhan contains. as for battlegrounds blizzard has released very little information. however they have announced plans to make some of the battles from the past accessible through the caverns of time. blood elves: the new race thousands of years ago the exiled highborne landed on the shores of lordaeron and founded the enchanted kingdom of quel'thas. these high elves as they called themselves created a fountain of vast magical energies within the heart of their land -- the sunwell. over time they grew dependant on the sunwell's unstable energies regardless of the bitter lessons they'd learned in ages past. during the third war the villainous prince arthas invaded quel'thalas and reduced the once-mighty realm to rubble and ashes. his undead army decimated nearly all of the high elven population. in addition he used the sunwell's energies to resurrect a powerful undead lich kel'thuzad thereby fouling the sunwell's mystical waters. the few elven survivors realizing that they had been cut off from the source of their arcane power grew increasingly volatile and desperate. in the midst of the elves' darkest hour came kael'thas sunstrider the last of quel'thalas' royal bloodline. kael as he was commonly known knew that the remnant of his people would not long survive without the nourishing magic that once empowered them. renaming his people blood elves in honor of their fallen countrymen kael taught the survivors how to tap into ambient mystical energies -- even demonic energies -- in order to sate their terrible thirst for magic. in search of a new destiny for his people kael'thas ventured to the remote world of outland where he encountered the fallen night elf illidan. under illidan's watchful eye kael and his blood elves regained much of their former power. unfortunately the blood elves practice of embracing demonic energies caused their former comrades in the alliance to shun them. thus the remaining blood elves on azeroth look desperately to the horde to help them reach outland where they can reunite with kael'thas and achieve the golden destiny he has promised them. outland: the new continent once the beautiful homeworld of the orcs all that remains of draenor is the scattered wastes of outland. following the second war the alliance invaded draenor by crossing through the dark portal. to their horror they discovered that ner'zhul -- the dark warlord of horde -- had constructed a series of new gateways that could lead the beaten horde to newer unspoiled worlds. as the alliance forces closed in around him ner'zhul opened his gateways as a means of escape. however his plan backfired and the gateway's clashing energies resulted in a massive catastrophic explosion that ultimately ripped the world of draenor to pieces. nearly thirteen years later -- towards the end of the third war -- the fallen night elf illidan discovered that huge chunks of draenor still existed floating upon the astral winds of the twisting nether. after his defeat at the hands of the evil prince arthas illidan fled to the remnants of draenor and dubbed them outland. he quickly seized control of the chaotic region and sealed the last of ner'zhul's gateways. though he is the undisputed ruler of the ravaged land illidan lives in fear that he will be discovered by his powerful enemies -- most notably arthas the new lich king and the remaining lords of the burning legion. for now outland is home to a number of scattered draenei tribes primitive orcs and powerful arcane creatures of the nether itself. agents of the burning legion have also targeted the region as a vital strategic location in their unending burning crusade to scour all life from the universe. what else can expected? blizzard has tantalized warcraft players with the brief glimpse into the burning crusade's storyline. will these heroes find friends or foes? what dangers and rewards lie in wait beyond the dark portal? and what will they do when they discover that the demons they thought were vanquished have returned to renew their terrible burning crusade? these and other questions will remain unanswered until the gameplay can be explored by role-playing warcrafters.

of information: handwritten notes. when it's time to gather information from other sources and in different ways other difficulties can arise. for instance because most people don't have a way of digitally capturing unstructured information they often print out web research and store information in file folders or on desks which is difficult to find later and inaccessible when you're away. and sharing information with others can be challenging--even when using e-mail it can be hard to hard to figure out what the plan is without reading through long e-mail threads that may or may not contain

information mark notes with note tags visually rich icons that make it easier to return to reminders to-dos and other action items. work together more effectively with team members working from

information causing confusion and bloated e-mail inboxes. tasks action items agendas and issues stored within static documents or document management systems are difficult to update track and access and they prevent multiple people from working with the same information at the same time. onenote 2007 helps people work together better by eliminating roadblocks that arise when information is isolated in paper notes or file folders or on one person's computer. groups can share information easily work more productively and keep track of projects issues and goals more effectively. individuals can work together from the same notebook--whether online or offline--using shared notebooks. onenote2007 manages changes made to the same notebook eliminating the need to track versions or upload changes. you can also create a team knowledge base so that everyone has access to the same information helping to get new team members up to speed quickly and minimizing duplicate efforts. share notes even with non-onenote 2007 users by sending your notes as html so that anyone with an e-mail client or web browser can view them and stay in control of your information by choosing which notebooks to share with your teammates and which to keep private and help ensure privacy with password protection. you can even use onenote 2007 as a shared digital whiteboard enabling virtual teams to work together in real time viewing and editing the same set of notes.

106,35, [COL] title [VAL] cisco security server agent for windows and solaris - license - 100 agents - win solaris ( csa-b100-srvr-k9 ) [COL] description [VAL] the next-generation cisco security agent network security software provides threat protection for server and desktop computing systems also known as endpoints. the cisco security agent goes beyond conventional endpoint security solutions by identifying and preventing malicious behavior before it can occur thereby removing potential known and unknown security risks that threaten enterprise networks and applications. because the cisco security agent analyzes behavior rather than relying on signature matching its solution provides robust protection with reduced operational costs. as recent high-visibility attacks like code red and the sql slammer worm have shown traditional technologies are limited in their abilities to combat the effects of new and evolving attacks. customers require host security that protects throughout all stages of an attack and provides important protection against new and unknown threats. assaults on network systems typically go through stages. cisco recognizes that only a layered approach is effective against security breaches that can occur at any stage from beyond the perimeter to the server or at the file level. the cisco security agent proactively defends against damage to a host throughout all stages of the attack whereas other technologies provide early-stage protection and only then when a signature is known. the cisco security agent is specifically designed to protect against new attacks where there is no known signature. the cisco security agent consists of a management console resident on a server and host-based agents that are deployed on mission-critical desktops and servers. the agents use the http and secure sockets layer (ssl) protocols (128-bit ssl) for the management interface and for the communications between agents and the management console.

1081,251, [COL] title [VAL] the sims 2 (mac) [COL] description [VAL] the sims was one of the most popular games ever made. in it players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people or sims and influence their paths toward success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. its open-ended blend of cartoonish behavior and everyday living is unique in an art form otherwise obsessed with carnage and sports. with the sims 2 longtime fans now have a deeper game with lots of ways to customize and share their experiences. the game will also attract first-timers because the goal-oriented gameplay and the luridly fun starter families make it easier to get into the action right out of the box. now sims are born with the traits of their parents families grow and sims grow old. the people in your neighborhood the game starts at the neighborhood level. here you can create a housing development from scratch or start with one of three premade neighborhoods each with its own theme. from there you'll settle on a house and a family of sims to control. create your own sim (above) or your own house (below) from scratch with advanced tools. aside from the basic needs carried over from the previous game sims now have aspirations wants and fears. the wants and fears are the day-to-day things that occupy their minds like wanting to see friends or get married and fearing death or being rejected for a kiss. satisfy their wants and they become more efficient at completing tasks you assign them. realize their fears and sims become lethargic cranky and unresponsive to your commands. aspirations are the big-picture things like raising a family becoming wealthy and gaining knowledge. succeed here and you'll be able to buy odd gifts for your sim to improve his or her life like a money tree that pays dividends or a fountain of youth water cooler. what else is new? of course you wouldn't be able to juggle all that if it weren't for the improved free will option which makes it easier for sims to fulfill their basic needs. the artificial intelligence of the game is noticeably improved; they won't turn on radios just as a family member is going to bed but strangely they do occasionally put their dishes on the floor. another big change in the series is the concept of the lifespan. now sims are born with the traits of their parents families grow and sims grow old. not only does this go hand in hand with aspirations (growing up is the first aspiration that a baby sim will have) it provides a limited time with which your sims can achieve their goals. the universal control panel helps you manage your sim family. a family affair the sims 2 not only lets you create just about any type of sim in any type of family build elaborate houses and even create a neighborhood from scratch but it also allows you to start the game in medias res with premade households. these families all have backstories that are smart spoofs of soap-opera plots--lots of scheming romance ghosts and family fighting. parents of teens shouldn't worry though because nudity is tastefully blurred out and woo-hoo between sims takes place completely under the covers. the esrb has given this a teen rating. if the sims 2 were a film it would likely land between pg and pg-13. the makers have included some nice tools to help share the universe you've created. for example you can capture in-game stills and video to show friends the private moments family interactions and house parties of your sims. you can even package a household to share as a blog or an album on a special web site. the sims 2 is for patient gamers. like life itself the game is filled with mundane details like getting ready for work and doing dishes. the game also demands a level of creativity from its players that the run-and-gun game genres wouldn't know what to do with. but those who stick with it will be rewarded with an absorbing amusing diversion and a virtual family history that they've created themselves. --porter b. hall set up a sims 2 machinima studio amazon.com contributor porter hall reveals how you can make movies using the sims as your actors. see his guide to setting up a sims 2 machinima studio.

easy to analyze the result and adjust the settings used to trace your image. efficient photo editing coreldraw graphics suite x3 puts the focus on providing design professionals with more efficient intuitive and accurate photo editing. corel photo-paint x3 is now significantly faster when working with large images and applying photo effects resulting in better real-time feedback and improving overall workflow efficiency. improved object handling gives designers more precise control in rotating skewing or distorting objects. for large images improved use of image cache provides significantly increased response time for previewing most effects and for manipulating objects. the new integrated image adjustment lab saves designers valuable time and is accessible from both corel photo-paint and coreldraw. design professionals often work with files that have poor color balance and contrast and they need to use multiple tools to make adjustments. the image adjustment lab addresses this problem by uniting a number of manual and automatic controls for common color and tone corrections providing an intuitive and fast way to achieve professional image adjustments. the image adjustment lab also lets users create snapshots of their adjustments with just one click. the snapshots appear below the working preview which lets users easily compare each snapshot against the original and choose the best result. built on the power of corel knockout the enhanced cutout lab includes new controls to simplify the process of cutting out image areas and to improve accuracy. the

4496,4434," [COL] title [VAL] Blood Ties (3) [COL] abstract [VAL] The Wilsons go on television to offer a reward. The newspapers are making the Homicide unit look bad and Barnfather wants quick resolution to the case. The man (and his wife) who gave up Junior Bunk are murdered; Falsone and Lewis investigate. The only survivor, their young son, is brought in to find out what he remembers. His memories-- and a recorded phone message-- lead Stivers to believe a former member of the Narcotics unit is involved. The officer cops to a deal that implicates Georgia Rae Mahoney, though Giardella doesn't want to pursue that yet. Falsone's questioning of the Mahoney shooting leads Cox to doubt her actions at the time of the investigation. Incriminating evidence leads the detectives to Hal Wilson being their prime suspect. Frank goes to interview Felix and Hal Wilson; son and father confront some long-standing issues. Hal's confession is inadmissible in court, the Wilsons leave the Baltimore area, and the case remains officially open.

Ballard and Gharty catch the case -- only there is no body or crime scene. Meanwhile, Munch and Bayliss investigate the death of an elderly woman that occurred during a break-in -- was it a homicide? Munch would rather leave for his weekend rendezvous with Billie Lou. Ballard and Gharty's investigation becomes a red-ball as they find evidence in the writer's office that a crime was committed. A break leads to the arrest of the literary agent and his accomplice, although Danvers can't guarantee a conviction. Falsone asks Ballard if she would like to go out Saturday night; just then the jury comes back. And a sharp-eyed juror insures that justice is done.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 24, 1993. The teleplay was written Jorge Zamacona based on a story by executive director Tom Fontana, and the episode was directed by Bruce Paltrow. In the episode, Crosetti focuses his investigation into the shooting of Officer Thormann on one suspect, while Lewis continues to investigate. Meanwhile, Pembleton and Bayliss pursue different leads in the murder case of 11-year-old Adena Watson.The shooting of a police officer and the murder of young girl were both directly inspired by real-life events chronicled in David Simon's non-fiction book, Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, on which the series was based. ''A Shot in the Dark'' continued a string of guest appearances by actress Edie Falco as Eva Thormann, the wife of Officer Thormann.''A Shot in the Dark'' was seen by 8.9 million households in its original broadcast. Although an improvement over the previous episode ''Son of a Gun'', the rating was considered a disappointment, continuing the show's downward trend in ratings. ''A Shot in the Dark'' suffered in particular due to direct competition from the 35th Grammy Awards. The episode, along with the rest of the first and second seasons of Homicide: Life on the Street was released on DVD in the United States on May 27, 2003.

106,131, [COL] title [VAL] cisco security server agent for windows and solaris - license - 100 agents - win solaris ( csa-b100-srvr-k9 ) [COL] description [VAL] the next-generation cisco security agent network security software provides threat protection for server and desktop computing systems also known as endpoints. the cisco security agent goes beyond conventional endpoint security solutions by identifying and preventing malicious behavior before it can occur thereby removing potential known and unknown security risks that threaten enterprise networks and applications. because the cisco security agent analyzes behavior rather than relying on signature matching its solution provides robust protection with reduced operational costs. as recent high-visibility attacks like code red and the sql slammer worm have shown traditional technologies are limited in their abilities to combat the effects of new and evolving attacks. customers require host security that protects throughout all stages of an attack and provides important protection against new and unknown threats. assaults on network systems typically go through stages. cisco recognizes that only a layered approach is effective against security breaches that can occur at any stage from beyond the perimeter to the server or at the file level. the cisco security agent proactively defends against damage to a host throughout all stages of the attack whereas other technologies provide early-stage protection and only then when a signature is known. the cisco security agent is specifically designed to protect against new attacks where there is no known signature. the cisco security agent consists of a management console resident on a server and host-based agents that are deployed on mission-critical desktops and servers. the agents use the http and secure sockets layer (ssl) protocols (128-bit ssl) for the management interface and for the communications between agents and the management console.

That doesn't mean Larry will get his $5,000 back, although he is forced to pay off his acupuncturist, even though his back isn't cured.

1089,1233, [COL] title [VAL] rollercoaster tycoon 3 (mac) [COL] description [VAL] released back in 1999 the original rollercoaster tycoon took the gaming world by surprise managing to capture the attention of both hardcore gamers and casual novices alike. rollercoaster tycoon 3 not only contains all of the same charm and joy of the original but wraps it up in a spectacular three-dimensional package. you can now rotate the camera and zoom in and out which allows you to more clearly see where a new ride will be placed and exactly how it will fit in your park. the 3d rendering also shows height and depth which isn't just a superfluous change but really assists you when building custom attractions. who knew that constructing and running an amusement park could be so much fun? now for the first time you can build operate and attend the amusement park of your dreams in rollercoaster tycoon 3. take a front row seat on any of your rides and zoom along with a pal. view larger. and speaking of the pals -- they are completely personalized with unique facial expressions and behaviors. view larger. who knew that constructing and running an amusement park could be so much fun? view larger. rollercoaster tycoon 3 allows four modes of play: tutorial career sandbox and custom scenario. the tutorial mode lets you quickly learn and experiment with how to set up and make use of all the game elements. sandbox mode provides you with a large map and unlimited money and makes all the rides scenery shops and paths immediately available. this mode is great for just having fun and creating that super amusement park you've always wanted without worrying about game elements such as time limits. the custom scenario as the name suggests lets you set up your own rules and requirements using the game engine. you can share custom scenarios with friends or find ones that other people have created and posted online. the career mode that constitutes the main gameplay is a bit different than it has been in the past with three goal sets of increasing difficulty for each scenario. your job in career mode is to build the theme park of your dreams by accomplishing certain goals for each scenario. these goals can range from pleasing vips who like clean parks or coasters with certain excitement values to keeping a certain number of people referred to in the game as peeps in your park for a specific amount of time. your ultimate goal besides providing entertainment to all is to work your way from apprentice though entrepreneur and eventually reach the lofty heights of tycoon. rollercoaster tycoon 3 includes a host of nice-touch elements. there is a fireworks display as well as an editor that lets you customize your fireworks. you can add music that plays in time to certain rides or with your fireworks show. you can light up the night with a stunning park-wide lighting system or take in the breathtaking vistas as nature intended with realistic sunsets moonlight and more. there is even a coaster cam that puts you right in the action. you can take a front row seat on any of your rides and zoom along with a peep. (the camera does such an amazing job of showing you what your death spiral coaster feels like that you might not want to play until at least an hour after you've eaten.) and speaking of the pals -- they are completely personalized fully-animated individuals with unique facial expressions and behaviors. for example teenagers often run straight to the high-excitement level coasters while the younger kids like to stay on the more gentle rides and the older folks tend to complain and chase both sets of kids around. you can even create your own family members and friends and add them to your park where they will actually take pictures that will download directly to your my documents folder. there's also a lot of content to explore as rollercoaster tycoon 3 includes five separate themes including generic spooky western adventure and sci-fi. each theme has distinctive rides amusements and shops as well as animatronics and decorations. the game's sweeping variety lets you do virtually anything from setting up water rides that have mechanical great-white sharks lurching out of the water to creating a roller coaster straight out of your imagination. there are 18 distinct scenarios in the game with two that are only playable when unlocked. beating the apprentice level of difficulty on each of the initially unlocked scenarios will unlock a new scenario but you have to beat the much more difficult entrepreneur and tycoon settings on all the levels to unlock the final two scenarios. when it comes to the creative aspect of the game rollercoaster tycoon 3 will allow players to create some spectacular parks with a level of detail they're sure to love. if you were a fan of the first two versions you'll love this one. but if you never played the originals but love theme parks you owe it to yourself to give rollercoaster tycoon 3 a try.
