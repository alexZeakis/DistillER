They are tied for the lowest price.\n\nHowever, we can see that Record 9 has a similar title to Record 1 and Record 3, but it's in GBP instead of USD. Let's convert its price to USD:\n\n$1482.0 GBP \u2248 $1875.51 USD\n\nRecord 9 is more expensive than Records 1 and 3.\n\nSince we have multiple records that match the given product, let's choose one with a lower price. In this case, Record 1 has the lowest price among all matching records.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[1]\n\nExplanation: The corresponding record number surrounded by \"[]\" or \"[0]\" if there is none.",

Let's take a closer look at their descriptions:\n\n* Record 1: Adobe Creative Suite 3 Design Premium - Product Upgrade Package - 1 User - Upgra\n\t+ Description mentions \"Design Premium\".\n* Record 3: Adobe Creative Suite 3 Design Premium - Product Upgrade Package - 1 User - Upgra\n\t+ Description also mentions \"Design Premium\".\n\nBoth records match the given product, but they have different prices. Let's choose the one with the lower price.\n\nRecord 1 has a price of $1687.48, and Record 3 has a price of $1687.48 as well. They are tied for the lowest price.\n\nHowever, we can see that Record 9 has a similar title to Record 1 and Record 3, but it's in GBP instead of USD. Let's convert its price to USD:\n\n$1482.0 GBP \u2248 $1875.51 USD\n\nRecord 9 is more expensive than Records 1 and 3.\n\nSince we have multiple records that match the given product, let's choose one with a lower price. In this case, Record 1 has the lowest price among all matching records.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[1]\n\nExplanation: The corresponding record number surrounded by \"[]\" or \"[0]\" if there is none.",
