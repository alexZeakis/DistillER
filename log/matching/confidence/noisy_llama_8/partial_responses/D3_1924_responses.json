Viacad 2D/3D. The price is also very close, with only $0.05 difference. This suggests that the two records are likely referring to the same software product. Therefore, I have assigned a confidence score of 0.9.\n\nNote: The confidence score can be adjusted based on the specific requirements and criteria for entity matching. In this case, I have assigned a moderate confidence score as the candidate record is not an exact match but has many similarities with the given entity record.",
