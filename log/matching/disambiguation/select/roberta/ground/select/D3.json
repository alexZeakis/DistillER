instead the game allows you to customize your character's proficiencies and make dramatic changes to your skill set on the fly. also each character's set of statistics such as perception and belief predispose them toward one style of play or another. gameplay is primarily turn-based combat that occurs during randomly generated missions in search of targets or objects. you earn currency experience points and loot (such as weapons and other items) from accomplishing missions and defeating opponents. many missions have multiple stages and while it's possible to finish them on your own it's much more efficient to plow through them with a group of other players. the matrix online allows players to form groups of up to a dozen called crews that are more permanent in nature and multiple crews can come together to form a faction. in addition to fighting foes using hand-to-hand combat guns and viruses characters can create useful items by compiling them. one of the most enticing aspects of the matrix online is the promise of an evolving storyline that develops based on each players' actions ensuring that you will keep coming back not just for the thrill of the game but in order to see how the story turns out. both everquest games -- evolution and everquest ii -- take place in the world of norrath. view larger. everquest: evolution and everquest ii as the game that originally helped create the market for the massive multiplayer online role-playing genre the everquest line of role-playing games require little explanation. both everquest games -- evolution and everquest ii -- take place in the world of norrath but in everquest ii norrath has been stricken by a cataclysmic event that caused civilization to virtually collapse leaving only two main metropolises intact. in both evolution and everquest ii you must choose your character's race profession and alignment before you head out in to the world to gain experience win renown and hopefully become rich and powerful beyond your wildest dreams. everquest: evolution features the original game plus all of the expansion packs released so far including the ruins of kunark the scars of velious the shadows of luclin the planes of power and the legacy of ykesha. everquest ii includes the new world order a ton of original content breathtaking new graphics and several tweaks to gameplay such as a purely player-versus-environment gameplay design that removes the original everquest's option of attacking other players. as one of the most participated in and deeply developed massively-multiplayer online games ever created both everquest: evolution and everquest ii will provide you with virtually endless entertainment and challenges.

resizing an image larger than the original size requires that new pixels be created. this process is called interpolation or up-rezzing. there are many mathematical ways called algorithms to do this. the most common method used by default by many pixel editing applications is called bicubic interpolation. bicubic along with with its newer variants bicubic smoother and bicubic sharper work by averaging a small group of neighboring pixels to determine the color value of the new pixels to be added. while this technique is fast it does not distinguish edges so there is a uniform loss of sharpness and detail across the image. genuine fractals and bicubic smoother comparison genuine fractals 5 patented algorithms work differently. it starts by analyzing ever-decreasing sizes of pixel blocks in your image looking for repeating natural patterns at different sizes. these are known as fractals. fractals are common naturally repeating patterns found everywhere. for example a river system viewed from space has the same shape as the veins in a leaf. these are both fractal patterns at very different scales. the great thing about fractal patterns is once you find them they can be scaled to any size without loss in detail. this allows genuine fractals 5 to resize your image over 1000% without losing sharpness and edge detail. unmatched image resizing genuine fractals 5 can resize your images over 1000% and still maintain sharp edges and minute details. to give you an idea of how big that is you could take a full-frame image from a six megapixel image and resize it to make a print of 10x15 feet at 180 ppi! it is a must for any photographer or artist who makes large format or poster sized prints. it is also great for journalists sports and wildlife photographers who may need to take a cropped section of an image and still make a high-quality print from it. cropping can leave you with very few pixels to work with. if you where to crop this professional 12 megapixel image to keep just the antelope you would be left with only four megapixels of information barely enough to make a good 5x7 print. however with genuine fractals 5 you could make a print over 6 feet tall. save hard disk space and bandwidth increasing the size and resolution of a file results in a larger file on disk. you can reduce the disk space needed and bandwidth when transferring files by saving your files into the genuine fractals 5 .stn format which provides lossless and visually lossless wavelet compression to cut your file size in half or more. now you can store twice as many images on your hard drive and upload them in half the time. long time users of genuine fractals remember having to save files as a .stn file before being able to scale the image. in genuine fractals 5 any file that is opened in photoshop can be scaled in one easy step without having to save as a .stn file first. batch processing with genuine fractals 5 genuine fractals 5 can be automated easily by using a photoshop action. by default genuine fractals 5 remembers its last used setting--however you can create a photoshop action to resize an entire folder of images at the same time. not just for photographers genuine fractals 5 is not just for photographers but anyone who needs to resize images. graphic designers can end the everyday problem of receiving low resolution images from clients for high resolution print work. genuine fractals 5 can also help you create tradeshow and billboard graphics from average sized images. genuine fractals 5 is also commonly used by service bureaus as well as law enforcement and architects for resizing small files.
