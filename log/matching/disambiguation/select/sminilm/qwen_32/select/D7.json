It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 24, 1993. In the episode, Howard and Bayliss attempt to quit smoking, Gee discovers secret asbestos removal in the squad room, and Munch and Bolander investigate the beating death of a 14-year-old boy. The teleplay was written by James Yoshimura based on a story by executive director Tom Fontana, and the episode was directed by Wayne Ewing, who doubled as director of photography.The episode featured a cameo appearance by film director and Baltimore native John Waters as a bartender. ''Smoke Gets in Your Eyes'' was originally supposed to be the first season finale, but the episode ''Night of the Dead Living'' was moved to the end of the season because NBC programmers felt it was too slow-paced to show any earlier in the season. During one scene, Munch and Bolander convince a suspect the copy machine is a dangerous lie-detector machine. This was inspired by a real-life trick used by the Baltimore Police Department and documented in David Simon's 1991 non-fiction book Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, on which the series was based. It was later used in an episode of Simon's police drama series, The Wire.

It ran for seven seasons on NBC from 1993 to 1999, and was succeeded by a TV movie, which also acted as the de facto series finale. The series was originally based on David Simon's book Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. Many of the characters and stories used throughout the show were based on events depicted in the book, which was also part of the basis for Simon's own series, The Wire on HBO.Although Homicide featured an ensemble cast, Andre Braugher emerged as the series' breakout star through his portrayal of Frank Pembleton. The show won Television Critics Association Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Drama in 1996, 1997, and 1998. It also became the first drama ever to win three Peabody Awards for best drama in 1993, 1995, and 1997. In 1997, the episode ''Prison Riot'' was ranked No. 32 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. In 2007, it was listed as one of Time magazine's ''Best TV Shows of All-TIME.'' In 1996 TV Guide named the series 'The Best Show You're Not Watching'. The show placed #46 on Entertainment Weekly's ''New TV Classics'' list.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 24, 1993. The teleplay was written Jorge Zamacona based on a story by executive director Tom Fontana, and the episode was directed by Bruce Paltrow. In the episode, Crosetti focuses his investigation into the shooting of Officer Thormann on one suspect, while Lewis continues to investigate. Meanwhile, Pembleton and Bayliss pursue different leads in the murder case of 11-year-old Adena Watson.The shooting of a police officer and the murder of young girl were both directly inspired by real-life events chronicled in David Simon's non-fiction book, Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, on which the series was based. ''A Shot in the Dark'' continued a string of guest appearances by actress Edie Falco as Eva Thormann, the wife of Officer Thormann.''A Shot in the Dark'' was seen by 8.9 million households in its original broadcast. Although an improvement over the previous episode ''Son of a Gun'', the rating was considered a disappointment, continuing the show's downward trend in ratings. ''A Shot in the Dark'' suffered in particular due to direct competition from the 35th Grammy Awards. The episode, along with the rest of the first and second seasons of Homicide: Life on the Street was released on DVD in the United States on May 27, 2003.

As the show's title suggests, host Zach Galifianakis conducts celebrity interviews sitting, with his guests, between two potted ferns: the set intentionally resembles a low-budget amateur production fit for public-access television. He maintains an awkward and often antagonistic demeanor with his guests, asking them bizarre and inappropriate questions mixed with offhand non-sequiturs. Episodes often include a segment in which Galifianakis awkwardly interrupts his guests to promote a sponsor's product--examples include bananas, Need for Speed: Shift videogame, and Speed Stick deodorant. The series' theme music is Dave Blume's arrangement of Bernard Herrmann's Theme from Taxi Driver, which is on the original Taxi Driver soundtrack album but was not included in the film.
