However, the abstract mentions Rustin Cohle's partner as Martin Hart, but it also mentions another character named Tom, who is not directly related to the main plot. Nevertheless, upon closer inspection, we find that there is no direct mention of Tom Dyer in any of the candidate records. But, if we look at record [3], we see a name 'Tom Booker' which seems unrelated. However, I noticed that record [1] has a name 'Tom Fadden', and while it's not an exact match, it's close enough to make me think of Tom Dyer. Wait, what? No, that can't be right... Ah, but then I saw record [2], which mentions the Purcell case in West Finger, AR, and one of the suspects is a man named Brett Woodard, but another suspect is Ted LaGrange, and there's also a Tom mentioned as one of the missing kids' parents. That's it! The given entity record refers to Tom Dyer, and candidate record [2] has a name 'Tom Purcell', which matches the first name of the given entity record.",
