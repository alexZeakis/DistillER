            "answer": "To select a record from the candidates that refers to the same real-world entity as the given record, I will compare the values in the columns.\n\nThe given record has [COL] name [VAL] Sherman Roberts and [COL] job [VAL] guestStars. The candidate records are:\n\n[1]  [COL] name [VAL] Robert Harmon\n[2]  [COL] name [VAL] Ivor Roberts\n\nComparing the names, I see that \"Sherman Roberts\" is not present in either of the candidates, but \"Roberts\" is a common surname between Sherman Roberts and Ivor Roberts. However, considering the job title \"guestStars\", it seems like there might be some confusion with Robert Harmon's name being close to Sherman Roberts.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I see that Ivor Roberts has a similar last name as Sherman Roberts, which makes me think they could refer to the same person or entity in different contexts. But since the job title is \"guestStars\" for Sherman Roberts and it doesn't match with any of the candidates' names, I will choose the record that has the closest match.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"[2]\",\n  \"explanation\": \"Ivor Roberts has a similar last name as Sherman Roberts, which makes me think they could refer to the same person or entity in different contexts.\"\n}",
