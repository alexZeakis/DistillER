However, the modelno in the given entity record seems to be an internal or product code rather than a standard model number. In this case, it's possible that the modelno is not publicly available or is not used consistently across different sources.\n* The dimensions (14.5 x 11.25 x 3.25 inches) in the given entity record match the dimensions of the candidate record [4] (7.5 x 6.0 x 1.2 inches). However, this is likely due to a mistake in my analysis, as the dimensions do not seem to match.\n* The shipweight (1.04 pounds) in the given entity record matches the shipweight of the candidate record [4] (1 pound).\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realized that the modelno and dimensions in the given entity record do not match any of the candidate records.
