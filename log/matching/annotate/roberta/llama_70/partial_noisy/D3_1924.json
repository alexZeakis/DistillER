professional full version with sp2 [COL] description [VAL] with windows xp professional edition with service pack 2 you get safer browsing and communication powerful security tools and improved experiences. windows xp is the operating system release that unifies the microsoft range with all the desktop versions now built on the nt/2000 code base rather than the shakier foundation of windows 95 98 and me. that makes xp a great upgrade for users of the now-obsolete 9x and me line but for those already on windows 2000 professional it is a closer call. despite the similar name there is no special synergy between windows xp and office xp which works fine on windows 2000. the security center lets you check the status of your essential security settings. xp certainly looks different with rounded window corners larger and more detailed icons and a clean-look desktop that on first installation shows only the taskbar and recycle bin. xp is also more customizable than earlier versions of windows and includes visual themes that let you change the whole appearance of windows in an instant. that is the window-dressing but underneath are some significant improvements. one of the most interesting is remote desktop. a standard xp feature this uses technology from microsoft terminal server to enable users to access their computer over any connection; for example by dialing into the office from home. this is not just file access--this technology lets you run applications remotely as if you were sitting at your desk at work. this is mature technology stable and carefully thought out. so for example you can print from a remote word processor to a local printer. a variation on the theme is remote assistance where the user can allow a remote helper to view their desktop or optionally gain control of the keyboard and mouse in order to troubleshoot a problem. the feature can also be disabled to ease security concerns. laptop users benefit from enhanced power management with options to extend battery life by reducing cpu speed and display brightness. irda support has been fixed so that unlike windows 2000 windows xp can easily use modems in mobile telephones via infrared. a new screen font cleartype improves legibility for laptop or other flat screens and there is built-in support for wireless networking using the popular 802.11 standard. a great feature of xp also found in windows 2000 is the ability to synchronize network files with offline copies. previously these files could not be stored securely but now they can be encrypted. the information bar in windows xp professional edition with service pack 2 notifies you when it blocks activex control or active content and then lets you decide what to do. for web browsing xp comes with internet explorer 6.0. the enhancements in ie 6.0 are mainly of interest to web developers and in any case microsoft makes ie freely available to all windows users. although java is not installed by default it is not difficult to download a java virtual machine (jvm). windows messenger originally a chat client has evolved into a collaboration tool that allows for video conferencing and application sharing. service pack 2 allows users to instruct internet explorer how to handle downloads from a specific publisher the most significant new feature for internet users is the built-in firewall. a firewall protects against one of the most disturbing security risks in which other users unknown to you might connect to your computer while it is online reading private files or causing other damage. xp's built-in firewall is a simple affair but it does prevent most types of unauthorized connection. windows xp has strong multimedia features. the new media player lets you copy music from cd to hard disk create your own playlist and write your own music cds if you have a cd writer. although there is loss of quality as a result of compression the process is easy and convenient. media player 8.0 can play back dvd video but only if a hardware or software dvd decoder is already installed. you can also play mp3 audio files and mpeg videos but sadly not the popular realmedia formats. in the end media player does nothing that you cannot also do with free alternatives but it is slick and nicely integrated. the xp user interface is not a radical departure from earlier versions of windows but there are a number of small changes that together add up to a significant improvement. the start menu now automatically features the most frequently used programs at the top of the list and you can add and remove shortcuts by right-clicking the icon and selecting pin or unpin from the pop-up menu. windows online help is integrated into a help and support center that works like an internal web site with searchable help tutorials and walk-throughs. windows xp professional includes all the features of windows xp home and adds support for dual processors encryptable file systems offline folders the remote desktop as described above and extra administration features that come into play when connected to a windows server domain. xp is demanding on hardware and it would be a mistake to install it on less than microsoft's recommended minimum requirements. there is also activation to consider a mildly annoying anti-piracy measure that requires you to obtain a code from microsoft for full installation and in the future if you reinstall or make major system changes. windows xp service pack 2 features internet explorer pop-up blocker makes browsing the internet more enjoyable by enabling you to reduce unwanted ads and content. internet explorer download monitoring warns you about potentially harmful downloads and gives you the option to block files that could be malicious. internet explorer information bar provides better information about events that are happening as you browse the web so it& 8217;s easier to know what& 8217;s going on and address potential security issues. windows security center allows you to easily view your security status and manage key security settings in one convenient place. windows firewall update automatically turned on by default this improved firewall helps protect windows xp from viruses worms and other security threats that can spread over the internet. improved wireless support dramatically improves and simplifies the process of discovering and connecting to wireless networks. bluetooth technologies enables you to easily connect to the latest bluetooth-enabled hardware devices such as keyboards cell phones and pdas. windows media player 9 series makes it easy to enjoy music video and broadband content with enhanced security.

expansion: burning crusade [COL] description [VAL] blizzard entertainment took online role playing by storm with their hit title world of warcraft. with mind-boggling improvements in graphics gameplay networking and interface -- really every category -- this game became the crown prince of the genre. world of warcraft players will be excited by the approaching release of the new expansion pack: world of warcraft: the burning crusade. this pack expands the already massive award-winning multiplayer online role-playing game by tremendous bounds adding new races lands battlegrounds professions and items and much much more. although no release date has been set here is sample of what you can expect from the burning crusade. the burning crusade is the highly anticipated unreleased expansion pack for blizzard's world of warcraft. what lies in medivh's tower? view larger. blood elves emerge as a new race in the burning crusade. view larger. the blood elves seek the golden destiny that has been promised to them. view larger. warcraft's newest continent: outland. view larger. once a beautiful land outland has been ravaged by war. view larger. outland is a vital strategic location. view larger. the expansion pack features an increase in the level cap to 70. there are two new playable races including the magical blood elves that you can read more about below. the other race has not yet been released by blizzard. there will be new starting zones in quel'thalas and beyond. another eye-opening addition is the entirely new unexplored continent of outland that is reachable through the dark portal. plus you'll find many new high-level dungeons to explore in azeroth outland and elsewhere that will substantially boost gameplay. there are new flying mounts in outland; tons of new and dangerous monsters (including epic world bosses); hundreds of new quests and items; and even a new profession: jewelcrafting. of course this isn't the end of the list -- this is just a glimpse of what blizzard has planned for their unreleased expansion pack. the new story the rumors and more several years have passed since the burning legion's defeat at mount hyjal and the races of azeroth have continued to rebuild their once shattered lives. with renewed strength the heroes of the horde and alliance have begun to explore new lands and have broken through the dark portal to investigate the realms beyond the known world. in this expansion pack the burning crusade refers to the burning legion's ongoing efforts to destroy life on azeroth. to date the burning legion's exploits have been documented in warcraft iii and in the war of the ancients novel trilogy. as part of the expansion pack players will now be able to travel through the dark portal to confront the legion on otherworldly battlefields. although only one race has been revealed blizzard has announced plans to unveil details about possible additional races at a later date. on the other hand many details have been released about the new continent outland. players last visited outland in warcraft iii: the frozen throne alongside illidan as he conquered the pit lord magtheridon's domain. players will also gain access to quel'thalas the region to the northeast of the forsaken lands where the blood elves reside. blizzard says that this expansion pack holds even more new areas that are ripe for player exploration -- additional details will be revealed in the months ahead. blizzard also has plans to add new dungeons and battlegrounds with the expansion though the exact number has not yet been determined. one upcoming dungeon that has players excited is karazhan which is located within medivh's tower. because medivh has played such a central role in warcraft lore blizzard is convinced that longtime players will be especially interested in seeing what karazhan contains. as for battlegrounds blizzard has released very little information. however they have announced plans to make some of the battles from the past accessible through the caverns of time. blood elves: the new race thousands of years ago the exiled highborne landed on the shores of lordaeron and founded the enchanted kingdom of quel'thas. these high elves as they called themselves created a fountain of vast magical energies within the heart of their land -- the sunwell. over time they grew dependant on the sunwell's unstable energies regardless of the bitter lessons they'd learned in ages past. during the third war the villainous prince arthas invaded quel'thalas and reduced the once-mighty realm to rubble and ashes. his undead army decimated nearly all of the high elven population. in addition he used the sunwell's energies to resurrect a powerful undead lich kel'thuzad thereby fouling the sunwell's mystical waters. the few elven survivors realizing that they had been cut off from the source of their arcane power grew increasingly volatile and desperate. in the midst of the elves' darkest hour came kael'thas sunstrider the last of quel'thalas' royal bloodline. kael as he was commonly known knew that the remnant of his people would not long survive without the nourishing magic that once empowered them. renaming his people blood elves in honor of their fallen countrymen kael taught the survivors how to tap into ambient mystical energies -- even demonic energies -- in order to sate their terrible thirst for magic. in search of a new destiny for his people kael'thas ventured to the remote world of outland where he encountered the fallen night elf illidan. under illidan's watchful eye kael and his blood elves regained much of their former power. unfortunately the blood elves practice of embracing demonic energies caused their former comrades in the alliance to shun them. thus the remaining blood elves on azeroth look desperately to the horde to help them reach outland where they can reunite with kael'thas and achieve the golden destiny he has promised them. outland: the new continent once the beautiful homeworld of the orcs all that remains of draenor is the scattered wastes of outland. following the second war the alliance invaded draenor by crossing through the dark portal. to their horror they discovered that ner'zhul -- the dark warlord of horde -- had constructed a series of new gateways that could lead the beaten horde to newer unspoiled worlds. as the alliance forces closed in around him ner'zhul opened his gateways as a means of escape. however his plan backfired and the gateway's clashing energies resulted in a massive catastrophic explosion that ultimately ripped the world of draenor to pieces. nearly thirteen years later -- towards the end of the third war -- the fallen night elf illidan discovered that huge chunks of draenor still existed floating upon the astral winds of the twisting nether. after his defeat at the hands of the evil prince arthas illidan fled to the remnants of draenor and dubbed them outland. he quickly seized control of the chaotic region and sealed the last of ner'zhul's gateways. though he is the undisputed ruler of the ravaged land illidan lives in fear that he will be discovered by his powerful enemies -- most notably arthas the new lich king and the remaining lords of the burning legion. for now outland is home to a number of scattered draenei tribes primitive orcs and powerful arcane creatures of the nether itself. agents of the burning legion have also targeted the region as a vital strategic location in their unending burning crusade to scour all life from the universe. what else can expected? blizzard has tantalized warcraft players with the brief glimpse into the burning crusade's storyline. will these heroes find friends or foes? what dangers and rewards lie in wait beyond the dark portal? and what will they do when they discover that the demons they thought were vanquished have returned to renew their terrible burning crusade? these and other questions will remain unanswered until the gameplay can be explored by role-playing warcrafters.

(the camera does such an amazing job of showing you what your death spiral coaster feels like that you might not want to play until at least an hour after you've eaten.) and speaking of the pals -- they are completely personalized fully-animated individuals with unique facial expressions and behaviors. for example teenagers often run straight to the high-excitement level coasters while the younger kids like to stay on the more gentle rides and the older folks tend to complain and chase both sets of kids around. you can even create your own family members and friends and add them to your park where they will actually take pictures that will download directly to your my documents folder. there's also a lot of content to explore as rollercoaster tycoon 3 includes five separate themes including generic spooky western adventure and sci-fi. each theme has distinctive rides amusements and shops as well as animatronics and decorations. the game's sweeping variety lets you do virtually anything from setting up water rides that have mechanical great-white sharks lurching out of the water to creating a roller coaster straight out of your imagination. there are 18 distinct scenarios in the game with two that are only playable when unlocked. beating the apprentice level of difficulty on each of the initially unlocked scenarios will unlock a new scenario but you have to beat the much more difficult entrepreneur and tycoon settings on all the levels to unlock the final two scenarios. when it comes to the creative aspect of the game rollercoaster tycoon 3 will allow players to create some spectacular parks with a level of detail they're sure to love. if you were a fan of the first two versions you'll love this one. but if you never played the originals but love theme parks you owe it to yourself to give rollercoaster tycoon 3 a try.
