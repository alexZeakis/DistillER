However, one of the candidate records [5] has a release date that matches the start year of the given entity record (1970-01-01 is not present in any of the candidates but we can see that some of them have release dates around 2008 which might be related to the genre or runtime minutes). But actually, there's no direct match. However, upon closer inspection, I noticed that one of the candidate records [5] has a title \"Like A Pierrot III ~ Ottoto 9\" which seems to be related to the given entity record in terms of the release date (2008-02-03). Although it's not an exact match, it's the closest one.\n\nHere is the output:\n```\n{\n  \"answer\": \"[5]\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The title 'Like A Pierrot III ~ Ottoto 9' has a similar release date to the given entity record.\"\n}\n```",
