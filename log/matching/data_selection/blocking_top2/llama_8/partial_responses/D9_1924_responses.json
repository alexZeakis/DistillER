Snodgrass\" which matches with the authors of candidate records [7], [8], and [9] \"RT Snodgrass\", but only one of them has a matching year, which is 2003 in both the given entity record and candidate record [6].\n* The venue of the given entity record is \"SIGMOD Record\" which matches with the venue of candidate records [1], [2], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], and [9] \"SIGMOD Record\".\n* The year of the given entity record is 2003 which matches with the year of candidate record [6].\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [5]\n\nAnd here's a brief explanation:\n\nThe corresponding record number is [5] because it has matching titles, authors (with a slight variation in initials), venue, and year with the given entity record.",
